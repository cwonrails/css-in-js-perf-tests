# CSS-in-JS Performance Tests

Testing a couple of CSS-in-JS libraries, check [the source folder](./src/) for the different tests.

And read why we did these tests in the [CSS-in-JS Battle](https://engineering.hellofresh.com/the-css-in-js-battle-89c34a7a83ea) article.

## Usage

You can clone this repository, `npm install` and run `npm run bench` to run the tests yourself.

To set the amount of iterations (see below) you can set an environment variable called `ITERATIONS`. This will result in: `ITERATIONS=100 npm run bench`.

> Make sure you have Node6 or higher installed as well.

## Specs

The specs from the machine on which the tests were run:

```
$ node -v
v6.3.0

$ /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
Hardware:

    Hardware Overview:

      Model Name: MacBook Pro
      Model Identifier: MacBookPro12,1
      Processor Name: Intel Core i7
      Processor Speed: 3,1 GHz
      Number of Processors: 1
      Total Number of Cores: 2
      L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB

## Results

The first test is just a simple render test, generates two classes, one for a container and one for a button.

The second test overloads on styles, so it adds `n (ITERATIONS)` amount of different styles with a common part for the buttons. Show which libraries can detect the common part and isolate it.

The third test overloads on classes, so it adds `n (ITERATIONS)` amount of different class names with the same styles. This test is interesting to see which library actually merges these styles when they're identical.

### View generated code

Launch with `npm run view`.

Find the generated HTML files with their embeded CSS for each test in the `output` directory.

Some observations:

For all of them, class name is stable between generations if same content. Unless said otherwise, the generated CSS is minimized.

#### aphrodite and aphrodite-no-important

(simple) Removes a non-used class. Generates class names like `original-name_1fm03kj`. By default, adds `!important` to each CSS property, *aphrodite-no-important* generates CSS without it.
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Doesn't detect identical classes that remain duplicate.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

#### cssobj

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `original-name_13otckp1_` (customizable suffix).
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Doesn't detect identical classes that remain duplicate.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

#### cxs and cxs-optimized

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `cxs-4211614354`.
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Detects identical classes that are merged.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

cxs-optimized can generate some specialized classes (with names like `cxs-display-block` or `cxs-text-align-center`) removed from the classes using these styles and added to elements using them. Seems limited to properties with a small number of possible values. Named colors are not deduplicated.

#### fela

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `a`, `b`, `c`. Each class has one property only, they are merged at element level.
(style overload) Styles common to several classes go to classes added to all corresponding elements.
(classes overload) Detects identical classes that are merged.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

#### free-style

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `f1lzwo7y`.
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Detects identical classes that are merged.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

#### glamor

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `css-h433f4`. Add selectors like `[data-css-h433f4]`.
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Detects identical classes that are merged.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries. Adds selectors like `css-1u8v7v4[data-simulate-hover]`.

#### j2c

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `original-name_j2c_5atjj2_120pllj_lsbclb_1lwh5gt_0`. Class names change between generations. CSS is minified with newlines.
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Doesn't detect identical classes that remain duplicate.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

#### jss and jss-without-preset

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `original-name-3553477605`. CSS is formatted and indented (1 space).
(style overload) Different classes with a common style are kept as is.
(classes overload) Doesn't detect identical classes that remain duplicate.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.

#### styletron

(simple) Doesn't remove a non-used class. Generates class names like `a`, `b`, `c`. Each class has one property only, they are merged at element level (starts with a space).
(style overload) Styles common to several classes go to classes added to all corresponding elements.
(classes overload) Detects identical classes that are merged.
(nested) Manages pseudo-classes and media queries.
